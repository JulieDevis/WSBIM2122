# Collaborating with Git and GitHub {#sec-git}


## Introduction

Why ? Student's feedback on the difficulty of collaborative work on R code and 
rmd files. Git and GitHub are the tools that experts use for code sharing and 
collaborative work. 

What is version control : what is it, why (line-by-line difference, clarity), 
how does it differ from other tools (cloud/drive). 

## Theoretical concepts of Git and GitHub

Understand the theoretical concepts of using Git and GitHub: repo (local and 
remote), pull, push, commit, clone, conflicts, issues, pull request (which 
prevents conflicts). Explain with a concept map 

Exercises and demo
o GitHub: Create an account, log in.
o Demo: they create tehir own repo, try and open an issue
o We've created a test repo (which has one or two files) and we 
add them to it to demonstrate : They can create an issue to show that they have
access to the online repo, comment on it, link to one of the files, assign 
someone, close an issue, etc.

## Git and RStudio

This section of the course is based on the *Happy Git and GitHub for the useR* 
tutorial by Jennifer Bryan.

### Install Git

Git needs to be install on your computer so RStudio can call it, or it can be 
used at the command line. This is different depending on the operating system
of your computer.

- **Windows users**

The easiest way is to install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), 
also called "Git bash". This allows to get Git but also a Bash shell that is 
useful to venture outside of R/RStudio. 

When installing Git for Windows, use the conventional location as it is going to
help other programs to find Git. RStudio prefers for Git to be installed in 
"C:/Program Files". Also, when asked about “Adjusting your PATH environment”, 
select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”. Otherwise,
use the defaults parameters.


- **macOS users**

On macOS, Git can be installed directly from the shell by using this command : 

``` bash
git config
```

This will open an offer to install developer command line tools, accept the 
offer and click on "Install".

This might have to be redone after upgrading macOS or the RStudio Git pane can
disappear from a system where it was previously working. 

### Connect RStudio to your GitHub repo

Connect local RStudio with a repo: create PAT and, new project with their first
repo, stage/commit/push a R/Rmd file, modify and compile, push, go see on GitHub
their pdf and the changes in the commit, change on  github (README ?) and pull
(always before a commit !), have a look at commit history, talk about .gitignore
(max 50 mb to push)

## Git and command line

Can be done with command line, show examples to connect to shell

## Troubleshooting

Remind you of good practice: coordinate your work so that only one of you is 
working on the same thing, pull/push regularly, work on different files. 

Exercise with modification on Github and Rstudio and have to resolve it (check
errors with RStudio !).

Demonstration of pull requests as another useful concept.

## WSBIM2122 Project

How are they going to be able to use this for their project: we're going to 
create 4 private repos to which we'll add them and we'll put a README file with 
the experimental design and a data file with the data.
