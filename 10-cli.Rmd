# The shell {#sec-cli}

This chapter is based on the Data Carpentries [The Unix
Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) and [Introduction
to the Command Line for
Genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/) lessons.

## Introduction


Learning objectives:

- Learn what the shell is and why it is important for bioinformatics.
- Learn how to work with files and navigate directories.
- Learn how run shell scipts.



### What is a shell and why should I care? {-}

A shell is a computer program that presents a command line interface
which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with
a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
with a mouse/keyboard combination.

There are many reasons to learn about the shell:

- Many bioinformatics tools can only be used through a command line
  interface, or have extra capabilities in the command line version
  that are not available in the GUI. This is true, for example, of
  [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), which offers many
  advanced functions only accessible to users who know how to use a
  shell.
- In bioinformatics you often need to do the same set of tasks with a
  large number of files. Learning the shell will allow you to automate
  those repetitive tasks and leave you free to do more exciting
  things.
- The shell makes your work less error-prone. When humans do the same
  thing a hundred different times (or even ten times), they're likely
  to make a mistake. Your computer can do the same thing a thousand
  times with no mistakes.
- The shell makes your work more reproducible. When you carry out your
  work in the command-line (rather than a GUI), your computer keeps a
  record of every step that you've carried out, which you can use to
  re-do your work when you need to. It also gives you a way to
  communicate unambiguously what you've done, so that others can check
  your work or apply your process to new data.
- Many bioinformatic tasks require large amounts of computing power
  and can't realistically be run on your own machine. These tasks are
  best performed using powerfull remote computers or cloud computing,
  which can only be accessed through a shell.

In this lesson you will learn how to use the command line interface to
move around in your file system.

### How to access the shell {-}

On a Mac or Linux machine, you can access a shell through a program
called Terminal, which is already available on your computer. If
you're using Windows, you'll need to download a separate program to
access the shell.nux machine, you can access a shell through a program
called Terminal, which is already available on your computer. If
you're using Windows, you can install a [Windows Subsystem for
Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). We
are going to the use RStudio Terminal.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/rstudio_terminal.png")
```

At any point, you can use the `clear` command or the `Ctrl+L` keyboard
shortcut to clear the screen.


### The Shell {-}

The shell is a program where users can type commands. With the shell,
it's possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling
software or simple commands that create an empty directory with only
one line of code. The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne
Again SHell â€” so-called because it's derived from a shell written by
Stephen Bourne). Bash is the default shell on most modern
implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like
tools for Windows.

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a prompt,
indicating that the shell is waiting for input.

```
$
```

The shell typically uses `$` as the prompt, but may use a different
symbol. In the examples for this lesson, we'll show the prompt as $
. Most importantly: when typing commands, either from these lessons or
from other sources, do not type the prompt, only the commands that
follow it.

So let's try our first command, `ls` which is short for listing. This
command will list the contents of the current directory:

```
$ ls
Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public
```

If the shell can't find a program whose name is the command you typed,
it will print an error message such as:

```
$ ks
ks: command not found
```

This might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program
corresponding to that command is not installed.

## Navigating Files and Directories

Let's find out where we are by running a command called pwd (which
stands for "print working directory"). At any moment, our current
working directory is our current default directory, i.e., the
directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in, unless
we explicitly specify something else. Here, the computer's response is
/home/dcuser, which is the top level directory within our cloud
system:

```
$ pwd
/home/lgatto
```

To create a shared set of files and directories, we will use the
`rWSBIM2122::prepare_shell()` function in RStudio's R console:

```{r rm_wsbim2122_data, echo = FALSE}
unlink("wsbim2122_data", recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

```{r prepare_wsbim2122_data}
rWSBIM2122::prepare_shell()
```
This R command could also be executed from the shell by executing a
(short) R script on the fly. `R -e` below means to start R, execute a
script, and then exit. The script follows that command and is provided,
here, as a quoted R expression - it could also be an R script file.

```
$ R -e 'rWSBIM2122::prepare_shell()'
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Using the `ls` shell command in the Terminal, verify that you have a
new directory called `wsbim2122_data`.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

Let's say we want to navigate to the `wsbim2122_data` directory we saw
above. We can use the `cd` command (*change directory*) to get there:

```
$ cd wsbim2122_data
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

What files and/or directories can you find in the `wsbim2122_data`
directory? You can make the `ls` output more comprehensible by using
the flag `-F`, which tells ls to add a trailing `/` to the names of
directories.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`ls` has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type:

```
$ man ls
```

`man` (short for manual) displays detailed documentation (also
referred as man page or man file) for `bash` commands. It is a
powerful resource to explore bash commands, understand their usage and
flags. Some manual files are very long. You can scroll through the
file using your keyboard's down arrow or use the `Space` key to go
forward one page and the `b` key to go backwards one page. When you
are done reading, hit `q` to quit.

An alternative to access the manual page (and sometimes, depending on
the environment, only one is available) is the pass `--help` to the
command:

```
$ ls --help
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Use the `-l` option for the ls command to display more information for
each item in the directory. What is one piece of additional
information this long format gives you that you don't see with the
bare ls command?

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


### Shortcut: Tab Completion {-}

Typing out file or directory names can waste a lot of time and it's
easy to make typing mistakes. Instead we can use tab complete as a
shortcut. When you start typing out the name of a directory or file,
then hit the `Tab` key, the shell will try to fill in the rest of the
directory or file name.

Return to your home directory:

```
$ cd
```

then enter:

```
$ cd wsbi<tab>
```

The shell will fill in the rest of the directory name for
`wsbim2122_data`.

Tab completion isn't limited to `cd`; it works with any shell command.

Using tab completion will save you a lot of typos and time!

```
$ cd wsbim2122_date
cd: wsbim2122_date: No such file or directory
```

### Hidden files and directories

Files and directories that start with a `.` are hidden, i.e that they
won't show up with `ls`. To display *all* files and directories,
including the hidden ones, you can use the `-a` flag.

```
$ ls -a
```

You can combine multiple flags in two ways:

```
$ ls -F -a
$ ls -Fa
```

In addition to these hidden files, such as `.bash_profile`, you will
also two hidden directories, namely `.` and `..`. `.` refers to the
current directory (the one shown by `pwd`) and `..` refers to the
parent directory.

We have seen how we can use `cd wsbim2122_data` to move into
`wsbim2122_data`. To move back out of `wsbim2122_data`, you can use:

```
$ cd ..
```

The shell interprets the character `~` (tilde) at the start of a path
to mean *the current user's home directory*.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

- Navitage to the `wsbim2122_data` directory. From there, list the files
  and directories in it's parent directory.

- Using a single command, list the files and directries in your home
  directory. Make sure this command will work from anywhere on your
  system.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


## Working with Files and Directories

To create a directory, you can use the `mkdir` command, short for
*make directory*:

```
$ mkdir my_dir
```

To create (empty) files, use the `touch` command:

```
$ touch my_file.txt
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Make sure you are in the `wsbim2122_data` directory and create a new one
called `wsbim2122_notes` and, in that directory, 3 files respectively
called `shell_notes.txt`, `report.Rmd` and `omics.md`.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

Note that the files created above contain a **file name**
(`shell_notes`, `report`, `omics`) and the **file extension** (`txt`,
`Rmd` and `md`)! You can of course create a file without extension,
but you (and the computer) won't know what type of file it is from its
name.

The tips about variable naming that we saw in previous years also hold
for file names. Complicated names of files and directories can make
your life painful when working on the command line. Here we provide a
few useful tips for the names of your files.

1. Don't use spaces. Spaces can make a name more meaningful, but since
   spaces are used to separate arguments on the command line it is
   better to avoid them in names of files and directories. You can use
   `-` or `_` instead.
2. Don't begin the name with `-` (dash). Commands treat names starting
   with - as options.

3. Stick with letters, numbers, . (period or â€˜full stop'), - (dash)
   and _ (underscore).

Many other characters have special meanings on the command line. There
are special characters that can cause your command to not work as
expected and can even result in data loss.

If you need to refer to names of files or directories that have spaces
or other special characters, you should surround the name in quotes
("").

### Viewing files {-}

To view a file, you can use `cat` to display the whole file at
once. This might work for the file that you just edited (try it out),
but not for any of the files in the `wsbim2122_data/data` directory.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

- Navigate to the `wsbim2122_data/data` directory.
- View the content of one of the files starting with `seq`.
- Use either of `head` or `tail` to view the few first and last lines
  of that fils.
- How many first and last lines to you see? Read the `head` manual
  page to view the 20 first/last lines.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`cat` is a terrific program, but when the file is really big, it can
be annoying to use. The program, `less`, is useful for this
case. `less` opens the file as read only, and lets you navigate
through it. The navigation commands are identical to the man program:

- use `b` to go backward
- use `g` to go to the beginning
- use `G` to go to the end
- use `q` to quit

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

View any of the `seq` using `less`.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`less` also gives you a way of searching through files. Use the `/`
key to begin a search. Enter the word you would like to search for and
press enter. The screen will jump to the next location where that word
is found.

**Shortcut**: If you hit `/` then `enter`, less will repeat the
previous search. less searches from the current location and works its
way forward. Scroll up a couple lines on your terminal to verify you
are at the beginning of the file. Note, if you are at the end of the
file and search for the sequence `CAA`, less will not find it. You
either need to go to the beginning of the file (by typing g) and
search again using `/` or you can use `?` to search backwards in the
same way you used `/` previously.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Search for the sequence `TATATA` in your file.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

### Using a text editor in the shell? {-}

For this course, given that we are using RStudio, you will be able to
view and edit your files with it directly. However, this won't be
possible if you use the terminal outside of RStudio, such as when you
connect to a server.

There exist several text-based editors, i.e. editors that can be used
in the shell without a dedicated graphical user interface. Here, we
will use `nano` for its simplicity.

Open one of the files that you just created with

```
$ nano shell_notes.txt
```

Let's type in a few lines of text. Once we're happy with our text, we
can press `Ctrl+O` (press the `Ctrl` or `Control` key and, while
holding it down, press the `O` key) to write our data to disk (we'll
be asked what file we want to save this to: press `Return` to accept
the suggested default).

Once our file is saved, we can use `Ctrl+X` to quit the editor and
return to the shell.

### Creating, moving, copying, and removing {-}

Make sure you are inside the `wsbim2122_data/data` directory and create
two new directories, namely `fas` and `sim`.

To copy the `seq_1.fas` file into the `fas`:

```
$ cp seq_1.fas fas
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

- Verify that the file now also exists in the `fas` directory.
- Copy the `sim_1.csv` file into the `sim` directory and check that it
  worked.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


To move the `seq_2.fas` file into the `fas`:

```
$ mv seq_2.fas fas
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

- Verify that the file now also exists in the `fas` directory only.
- Move the `sim_2.csv` file into the `sim` directory and check that it
  worked.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

We now have two copies of the `seq_1.fas` and `sim_1.csv` files. The
`rm` command can be used to delete them, either one by one

```
$ rm seq_1.fas
$ rm sim_1.csv
```

or in one go

```
$ rm seq_1.fas sim_1.csv
```

We can use wildcards for accessing or manipulate multiple files at
once. For instance, to move all `fas` files to the `seq` directory, we
can:

```
$ mv seq*.fas seq
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

1. Copy all the `csv` files into the `sim` directory.
2. Delete all `csv` files in the `data` directory.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Reproduce the following folder structure

```
wsbim2122_data/new_dir
wsbim2122_data/new_dir/file1.txt
wsbim2122_data/new_dir/file2.txt
wsbim2122_data/new_dir/data/seq_1.fas
wsbim2122_data/new_dir/data/sim_100.csv
```

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

## Data analysis in the shell

Above, you searched for the `TATATA` pattern in one of the `fas`
files. We could do the same thing without opening the file with the
`grep` command.

```
$ grep TATATA seq_1.fas
```

The command above greps all the lines that match the pattern of
interest and prints them in the standard output. If there's one a few,
we could easily count the lines. Firstly, this approach is error
prone, as it relies on a manual step. Secondly, it doesn't
scale. Instead, we can use the `wc`, short for *word count*
command. Let first test it on the `seq_1.fas` file:

```
$ wc seq_1.fas
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

- Read the `wc` manual page to understand the output.

- Can you adapt the command above to return the number of lines only.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`



Below we first *redirect* the output of `grep` into a new file and
then count the number of lines with `wc`:


```
$ grep TATATA seq_1.fas > tatata_1
$ wc tatata_1
```

The `> file.txt` redirects the output to a file called `file.txt`. If
a file named `file.txt` already exists, the it will be overwritten. If
however, you want to add the output to `file.txt`, then you should use
`>>`. Execute following lines to compare the two redirection
operators.

```
$ wc -l seq_1.fas > nlines1.txt
$ wc -l seq_2.fas > nlines1.txt
$ wc -l seq_1.fas > nlines2.txt
$ wc -l seq_2.fas >> nlines2.txt
cat nlines1.txt
cat nlines2.txt
```

To avoid the creation of this intermediate file, the output of `grep`
can be directly piped into `wc`:

```
$ grep TATATA seq_1.fas | wc
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Cound the number of line containing the `TATATA` pattern in all the
`fas` files.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

- How many `fas` files do you have?

- Use `head` to extract only the sequence headers (the first lines)
  from all the `fas` files.

- Use `grep` to extract only the sequence headers (the first lines)
  from all the `fas` files.

- Use `grep` to extract everything but the sequence headers from all
  the `fas` files. See the `grep` manual page to find an appropriate
  tag.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
- Navigate to your directory containing the `sim_*.csv` files.
- Look at a couple of them and familiarise yourselves with their
  content.
- How many files are there?
- How many points where simulated over all files?
- How many points with `id` b where simulated over all files?

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Image that you task is to load all the simulation data into R to
compare the `x` and `y` values for each `id`. You could [read each
file into R individually and then combine the
data](https://uclouvain-cbio.github.io/WSBIM1207/sec-prog.html#analysing-data-from-multiple-files).

An alternative would be to use what we have learned so far to create a
single file, `all_sims.csv` containing all the simulation data.

Check that the number of line in `all_sims.csv` matches what you found above.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


## Writing scripts

A really powerful thing about the command line is that you can write
scripts. Scripts let you save commands to run them and also lets you
put multiple commands together. Though writing scripts may require an
additional time investment initially, this can save you time as you
run them repeatedly. Scripts can also address the challenge of
reproducibility: if you need to repeat an analysis, you retain a
record of your command history within the script.

Let's create a shell script that combines all the simulation files
into a single new file. This will allow us to easily recreate that
file once additional simulations are performed.

- Start by creating a new file that will contain the script, giving
  it the extension `.sh`.

```
touch combine_all_simulations.sh
```

- Add the shell commands from the exercise into that file. You can use
  an editor, either `nano` directly from the terminal, or RStudio.

- Execute your script with

```
sh combine_all_simulations.sh
```

### Making the script into a program {-}

Let's test the `-l` (for long) tag of `ls`

```
$ ls combine_all_simulations.sh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 lgatto lgatto 79 sept. 17 22:32 combine_all_simulations.sh
```

This long output gives us, in addition to the file name, the time and
data is was created, the owner (and group) of the file (twice lgatto
here) and the files permissions.

There are ten slots in the permissions list. The first character in
this list is related to file type, not permissions, so we'll ignore it
for now. The next three characters relate to the permissions that the
file owner has, the next three relate to the permissions for group
members, and the final three characters specify what other users
outside of your group can do with the file. We're going to concentrate
on the three positions that deal with your permissions (as the file
owner).


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap="The 10 slots defining the file permission (figure from the Data Carpentry's [*Working with Files and Directories*](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/03-working-with-files/) lesson."}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/rwx_figure.svg")
```

Here the three positions that relate to the file owner are `rw-`. The
`r` means that you have permission to read the file, the `w` indicates
that you have permission to write to (i.e. make changes to) the file,
and the third position is a `-`, indicating that you don't have
permission to execute that file, i.e. to run it as a program.


Our goal for now is to change permissions on this file so that it
becomes executable. An for security purposes, we want only the file
owner to be able to execute it.

```
$ chmod u+x combine_all_simulations.sh
$ ls -l combine_all_simulations.sh
-rwxrw-r-- 1 lgatto lgatto 79 sept. 17 22:32 combine_all_simulations.sh
```

And now, it will be possible to execute the script without excplicitly
using `sh`.

```
combine_all_simulations.sh
```

If you want to make sure you don't want to inadvertently delete a
file, it is possible to remove all `w` permissions:

```
$ chmod a+w combine_all_simulations.sh
$ ls -l combine_all_simulations.sh
-r-xr--r-- 1 lgatto lgatto 79 sept. 17 22:32 combine_all_simulations.sh
```

If you now try to delete the file with `rm
combine_all_simulations.sh`, you'll be asked if you want to override
your file permissions:

```
rm: remove write-protected regular file â€˜combine_all_simulations.sh'?
```

If you enter `n` (for no), the file will not be deleted. If you enter
`y`, you will delete the file. This gives us an extra measure of
security, as there is one more step between us and deleting our data
files.

**Important**: The `rm` command permanently removes the file. Be
careful with this command. It doesn't just nicely put the files in the
Trash. They're really gone.

By default, `rm` will not delete directories. You can tell `rm` to
delete a directory using the `-r` (recursive) option.

To complete this chapter on shell, let's conclude by mentioning the R
`system()` and `system2()` functions, that enable to invoke a system
command such as a shell script:

```{r system, eval = FALSE}
system("combine_all_simulations.sh")
```
